        <p>Procedure for Stop and Wait ARQ</p>
<ol>
    
    <li>The aim is to introduce the students to the working of the Stop and Wait ARQ and how it behaves under the situations such as Frame Lost or Acknowledgement lost.</li>
    <li>Once one selects the Stop-and-Wait ARQ, then they are redirected to the simulation page</li>
    <li>Since Stop and Wait ARQ does not follow sliding window protocol, ONLY ONE frame should be selected at a time to move ahead with the simulation</li>
    <li>The user needs to make the right selections in the array for the simulation to run further.</li>
    <li>If the user fails to select the correct frame at any point of simulation , the “Wrong Frame Selected” is prompted on the right side of the screen and until the user successfully selects the correct frame , the simulation does not proceed and the User is given as many retries as needed.</li>
    <li>An index is provided to the left of the screen to allow the user to understand which color signifies what behaviour.</li>
